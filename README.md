# FUTURE_CS_02 â€“ SOC Simulation (Splunk)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is Task 2 of my Future Interns Cybersecurity Internship (Track Code: CS).  
I performed a **Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation**, where I monitored logs, analyzed alerts, and drafted an incident response report.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- Splunk (SIEM Tool)  
- Sample Log Files (Windows Event Logs, Web Logs)  
- Cybersecurity Monitoring & Detection Techniques  

## ðŸš€ Steps Taken
1. Ingested log data into Splunk.  
2. Monitored for **failed login attempts** and brute-force activity.  
3. Detected **malware infection patterns** and suspicious processes.  
4. Classified alerts based on severity.  
5. Drafted an **Incident Response Report** with mitigation steps.
